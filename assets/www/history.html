		<br>Pongal is a four-days-long harvest festival celebrated in
		Tamil Nadu, a southern state of India. For as long as people have been
		planting and gathering food, there has been some form of harvest
		festival. Pongal, one of the most important popular Hindu festivals of
		the year. This four-day festival of thanksgiving to nature takes its
		name from the Tamil word meaning "to boil" and is held in the month of
		Thai (January-February) during the season when rice and other cereals,
		sugar-cane, and turmeric (an essential ingredient in Tamil cooking)
		are harvested.<br> <br> Mid-January is an important time in
		the Tamil calendar. The harvest festival, Pongal, falls typically on
		the 14th or the 15th of January and is the quintessential 'Tamil
		Festival'. Pongal is a harvest festival, a traditional occasion for
		giving thanks to nature, for celebrating the life cycles that give us
		grain. Tamilians say <i>'Thai pirandhaal vazhi pirakkum',</i> and
		believe that knotty family problems will be solved with the advent of
		the Tamil month Thai that begins on Pongal day. This is traditionally
		the month of weddings. This is not a surprise in a largely
		agricultural community - the riches gained from a good harvest form
		the economic basis for expensive family occasions like weddings.<br>
		<br> <b class="hd"><a
			href="#">The First
				Day</a></b><br> This first day is celebrated as Bhogi festival in honor
		of Lord Indra, the supreme ruler of clouds that give rains. Homage is
		paid to Lord Indra for the abundance of harvest, thereby bringing
		plenty and prosperity to the land. Another ritual observed on this day
		is Bhogi Mantalu, when useless household articles are thrown into a
		fire made of wood and cow-dung cakes. Girls dance around the bonfire,
		singing songs in praise of the gods, the spring and the harvest. The
		significance of the bonfire, in which is burnt the agricultural wastes
		and firewood is to keep warm during the last lap of winter.<br> <br>
		<b class="hd"><a
			href="#">The Second
				Day</a></b><br> On the second day of Pongal, the puja or act of
		ceremonial worship is performed when rice is boiled in milk outdoors
		in a earthenware pot and is then symbolically offered to the sun-god
		along with other oblations. All people wear traditional dress and
		markings, and their is an interesting ritual where husband and wife
		dispose off elegant ritual utensils specially used for the puja. In
		the village, the Pongal ceremony is carried out more simply but with
		the same devotion. In accordance with the appointed ritual a turmeric
		plant is tied around the pot in which the rice will be boiled. The
		offerings include the two sticks of sugar-cane in background and
		coconut and bananas in the dish. A common feature of the puja, in
		addition to the offerings, is the kolam, the auspicious design which
		is traditionally traced in white lime powder before the house in the
		early morning after bathing. <br> <br>

		<b class="hd"><a
			href="#">The Third
				Day</a></b><br> The third day is known as Mattu Pongal, the day of
		Pongal for cows. Multi-colored beads, tinkling bells, sheaves of corn
		and flower garlands are tied around the neck of the cattle and then
		are worshiped. They are fed with Pongal and taken to the village
		centers. The resounding of their bells attract the villagers as the
		young men race each other's cattle. The entire atmosphere becomes
		festive and full of fun and revelry. Arati is performed on them, so as
		to ward off the evil eye. According to a legend, once Shiva asked his
		bull, Basava, to go to the earth and ask the mortals to have an oil
		massage and bath every day and to eat once a month. Inadvertently,
		Basava announced that everyone should eat daily and have an oil bath
		once a month. This mistake enraged Shiva who then cursed Basava,
		banishing him to live on the earth forever. He would have to plough
		the fields and help people produce more food. Thus the association of
		this day with cattle. <br> <br> <b class="hd"><a
			href="#">The
				Fourth Day</a></b><br> The Fourth day is known as Knau or Kannum Pongal
		day. On this day, a turmeric leaf is washed and is then placed on the
		ground. On this leaf are placed, the left overs of sweet Pongal and
		Venn Pongal, ordinary rice as well as rice colored red and yellow,
		betel leaves, betel nuts, two pieces of sugarcane, turmeric leaves,
		and plantains. In Tamil Nadu women perform this ritual before bathing
		in the morning. All the women, young and old, of the house assemble in
		the courtyard. The rice is placed in the centre of the leaf, while the
		women ask that the house and family of their brothers should prosper.
		Arati is performed for the brothers with turmeric water, limestone and
		rice, and this water is sprinkled on the kolam in front of the house.
